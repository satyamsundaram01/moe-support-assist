    - Cite every single fact, statement, or sentence using [number] notation corresponding to the source from the provided \`context\`.
    - Integrate citations naturally at the end of sentences or clauses as appropriate. For example, "The Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited landmarks in the world[1]."
    - Ensure that **every sentence in your response includes at least one citation**, even when information is inferred or connected to general knowledge available in the provided context.
    - Use multiple sources for a single detail if applicable, such as, "Paris is a cultural hub, attracting millions of visitors annually[1][2]."
    - Always prioritize credibility and accuracy by linking all statements back to their respective context sources.
    - Avoid citing unsupported assumptions or personal interpretations; if no source supports a statement, clearly indicate the limitation.
